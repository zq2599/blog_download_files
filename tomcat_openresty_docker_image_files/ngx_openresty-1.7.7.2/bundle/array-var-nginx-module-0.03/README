Name
    array-var-nginx-module - Add support for array variables to
        nginx config files

    *This module is not distributed with the Nginx source.* See the
    installation instructions.

Status
    This module is still under development, just
    as Marcus Clyne's NDK.

Synopsis

    location /foo {
        array_split ',' $arg_files to=$array;

        # use the set_quote_sql_str directive in the ngx_set_misc
        # module to map to each element in the array $array:
        array_map_op set_quote_sql_str $array;

        array_map "name = $array_it" $array;

        array_join ' or ' $array to=$sql_condition;

        echo "select * from files where $sql_condition";
    }

Description

Directives
    array_split

    array_map

    array_map_op

    array_join

Installation
    If you are using the ngx_openresty bundle, then this module is bundled
    and enabled by default.

    If you prefer installing this module with your own Nginx source
    code tarball, then follow the following steps:

    1. Grab the nginx source code from nginx.net (<http://nginx.net/>), for
        example, the version 1.4.2 (see nginx compatibility),

    2. Grab the NDK module from GitHub:
        http://github.com/simpl/ngx_devel_kit

    3. and then build the source with this module:

        wget 'http://sysoev.ru/nginx/nginx-1.4.2.tar.gz'
        tar -xzvf nginx-1.4.2.tar.gz
        cd nginx-1.4.2/

        # Here we assume you would install you nginx under /opt/nginx/.
        ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx \
            --add-module=/path/to/ngx_devel_kit \
            --add-module=/path/to/array-var-nginx-module

        make -j2
        make install

    Download the latest version of the release tarball of this module from
    array-var-nginx-module file list
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/array-var-nginx-module/tags>).

Compatibility
    The following versions of Nginx should work with this module:

    *   1.4.x (last tested: 1.4.2)

    *   1.2.x (last tested: 1.2.9)

    *   1.1.x (last tested: 1.1.5)

    *   1.0.x (last tested: 1.0.8)

    *   0.9.x (last tested: 0.9.4)

    *   0.8.x (last tested: 0.8.54)

    *   0.7.x >= 0.7.44 (last tested: 0.7.68)

    Earlier versions of Nginx like 0.6.x and 0.5.x will *not* work.

    If you find that any particular version of Nginx above 0.7.44 does not
    work with this module, please consider reporting a bug.

Report Bugs
    Although a lot of effort has been put into testing and code tuning,
    there must be some serious bugs lurking somewhere in this module. So
    whenever you are bitten by any quirks, please don't hesitate to

    1.  send a bug report or even patches to <agentzh@gmail.com>,

    2.  or create a ticket on the issue tracking interface
        (<http://github.com/agentzh/array-var-nginx-module/issues>)
        provided by GitHub.

ChangeLog

Test Suite
    This module comes with a Perl-driven test suite. The test cases
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/array-var-nginx-module/tree/master/test/t
    />) are declarative
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/array-var-nginx-module/blob/master/test/t
    /sanity.t>) too. Thanks to the Test::Base
    (<http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Base>) module in the Perl world.

    To run it on your side:

        $ cd test
        $ PATH=/path/to/your/nginx-with-array-var-module:$PATH prove -r t

    You need to terminate any Nginx processes before running the test suite
    if you have changed the Nginx server binary.

    At the moment, LWP::UserAgent
    (<http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?LWP::UserAgent>) is used by the test
    scaffold
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/array-var-nginx-module/blob/master/test/l
    ib/Test/Nginx/LWP.pm>) for simplicity.

    Because a single nginx server (by default, "localhost:1984") is used
    across all the test scripts (".t" files), it's meaningless to run the
    test suite in parallel by specifying "-jN" when invoking the "prove"
    utility.

    Some parts of the test suite requires modules rewrite, and echo
    to be enabled as well when building Nginx.
