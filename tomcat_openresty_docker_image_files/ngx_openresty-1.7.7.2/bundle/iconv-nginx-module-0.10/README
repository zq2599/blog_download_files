Name
    iconv-nginx-module

Description
    This is a nginx module that uses libiconv to convert characters of
    different encoding. It brings the 'set_iconv' command to nginx.

    This module depends on the ngx_devel_kit(NDK) module.

Installation
        Get the nginx source code from nginx.org.
        Untar the source code and build nginx with this module.

            wget 'http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.2.7.tar.gz'
            tar -xzvf nginx-1.2.7.tar.gz
            cd nginx-1.2.7/

            ./configure \
                    --add-module=/path/to/ngx_devel_kit \
                    --add-module=/path/to/iconv-nginx-module

            make -j2
            make install

Usage
        set_iconv <destination variable> <from variable> from=<from encoding> to=<to encoding>;
        iconv_buffer_size <size>;   #default iconv_buffer_size is ngx_pagesize
        iconv_filter from=<from encoding> to=<to encoding>;

    Here is a basic example:
        #nginx.conf
        location /foo {
            set $src '你好'; #in UTF-8
            set_iconv $dst $src from=utf8 to=gbk; #now $dst holds 你好 in GBK
        }

        #everything generated from /bar will be converted from utf8 to gbk
        location /bar {
            iconv_filter from=utf-8 to=gbk;
            iconv_buffer_size 1k;
            #content handler here
        }
